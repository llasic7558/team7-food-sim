## What We Built

[Which services are replicated? How does load balancing work? What polish work was completed?]

## Individual Contributions

| Team Member | What They Delivered | Key Commits |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| Luka Lasic / `llasic7558` | Driver Service replication through Caddy; driver assignment locking for scaled replicas; prep worker DLQ hardening; rating-to-restaurant cache invalidation; Sprint 4 documentation/API polish; restaurant time adjustment for demo reliability. | `6fec18a`, `884753a`, `bee6947`, `2d3c0f3`, `494b3ba`, `30448eb`, `7a453f9`, `a213b24`, `78a886b`, `5e9ca2b` |

## Starting the System with Replicas

```bash
docker compose up --scale [service-name]=3 --scale [other-service]=2
```

After startup:

```
[Paste docker compose ps output here showing all replicas as (healthy)]
```

---

## What Is Working

- [ ] At least [N] services replicated via `--scale`
- [ ] Load balancer distributes traffic across replicas (visible in logs)
- [ ] Services are stateless — multiple instances run without conflicts
- [ ] `docker compose ps` shows all replicas as `(healthy)`
- [ ] System is fully complete for team size

## What Is Not Working / Cut

## k6 Results

### Test 1: Scaling Comparison (`k6/sprint-4-scale.js`)

| Metric | 1 replica | 3 replicas | Change |
| ------ | --------- | ---------- | ------ |
| p50    | | | |
| p95    | | | |
| p99    | | | |
| RPS    | | | |

[Explain the improvement. Which replica count started to show diminishing returns?]

### Test 2: Replica Failure (`k6/sprint-4-replica.js`)

Timeline:

| Time | Event |
| ---- | ----- |
| 0s   | k6 started, 3 replicas running |
| [t]s | Killed replica: `docker stop [container-id]` |
| [t]s | Surviving replicas absorbed traffic |
| [t]s | Replica restarted: `docker compose up -d` |
| [t]s | Traffic redistributed, back to normal |

```
[Paste k6 output showing before / during / after the failure — annotate with timestamps]
```

During failure — `docker compose ps`:

```
[Paste output showing stopped/unhealthy replica alongside healthy survivors]
```

After restart — `docker compose ps`:

```
[Paste output showing all replicas back to (healthy)]
```
