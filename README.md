## How to Start the System

```bash
# Start everything (builds images on first run)
docker compose up --build

# Start with service replicas (Sprint 4)
docker compose up --scale your-service=3

# Verify all services are healthy
docker compose ps

# Stream logs
docker compose logs -f

# Open a shell in the holmes investigation container
docker compose exec holmes bash
```

### Base URLs (development)

```
[your-service-name]    http://localhost:[port]
[your-service-name]    http://localhost:[port]
[worker-name]          http://localhost:[port]   (health endpoint only)
holmes                 (no port — access via exec)
```

> From inside holmes, services are reachable by name:
> `curl http://your-service:3000/health`
>
> See [holmes/README.md](holmes/README.md) for a full tool reference.

## System Overview

[One paragraph describing what your system does and how the services interact.
Include which service calls which, what queues exist, and how data flows.]

---

## API Reference

<!--
  Document every endpoint for every service.
  Follow the format described in the project documentation: compact code block notation, then an example curl and an example response. Add a level-2 heading per service, level-3 per endpoint.
-->

---

### [Service Name]

### GET /health

```
GET /health

  Returns the health status of this service and its dependencies.

  Responses:
    200  Service and all dependencies healthy
    503  One or more dependencies unreachable
```

**Example request:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:[port]/health
```

**Example response (200):**

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "db": "ok",
  "redis": "ok"
}
```

**Example response (503):**

```json
{
  "status": "unhealthy",
  "db": "ok",
  "redis": "error: connection refused"
}
```

<!-- Add the rest of your endpoints below. One ### section per endpoint. -->
